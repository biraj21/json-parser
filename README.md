# JSON Parser in Go

My implementaion of a JSON parser in Go.

Why implement a JSON parser?
- It's fun.
- I wanted to learn Go.
- I was curious on how these langauge parsers worked under the hood.
- And I found this [amazing website](https://codingchallenges.fyi/) by [John Crickett](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johncrickett/). Challenge - [Write Your Own JSON Parser](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-json-parser).

### Acknowledgements:

I didn't know how to get started with this cuz I had no idea on how to implement a Lexer & Parser. [@eatonphil](https://github.com/eatonphil)'s [blog post](https://notes.eatonphil.com/writing-a-simple-json-parser.html) on the topic helped me a lot. Do check it out!
